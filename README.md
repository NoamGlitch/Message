Message Is a Free Game Idea (Hopefully will be a Full Game In The Future) Made in Ludum Dare 46
(My first time making a game in a jam and The Second game I Have ever made) With "The Team With No Name" Team.
We made the level short because of the time We didn't have, but We made a Touch from every Feature (Enemies, Bosses, etc.).

If you are Interested In These File Then Go For it. They're Completely Yours.

Something else from the game you wnt me to give you? write In the Comments There: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/message
if that site doesn't exist anymore (who know when you wtch it) just write in that github Comments.
And if i'm Dead (Don't judge me who know from which year you are) then i'm sorry but you'll be messed up.
